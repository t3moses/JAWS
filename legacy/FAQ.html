        <h2>Program registration</h2>
        <p>Q. I was registered in the Social Day-cruising program last season. Do I need to register again for the current season, or can I simply update my availability?</p>
        <p>A. The program database is erased at the end of the season.  So, you should reregister for the current season.</p>
        <p>Q. I want to update my personal details.  What should I do?</p>
        <p>A. Currently, it is not possible to access your account online.  You will have to contact the administrator who will erase the account.  Then you will be able to reregister using your revised details.</p>
        <p>Q. Why have I received an email from Amazon Web Services with the subject: Amazon Web Services - Email Address Verification?</p>
        <p>A. Future service enhancements, such as reminders and calendar notifications, require a verified email address.  You do not have to click the link in the email.  However, if you wish to take advantage of future enhancements, your email address has to be verified.</p>
        <p>The verification email is initiated by the program administrator.  So, some delay should be expected.</p>
         <h2>Event registration</h2>
        <p>Q. I have registered for one or more events.  But, now I find I can’t take part in one of them.  What should I do?</p>
        <p>A. On the program website update your availability for the relevant event.</p>
        <p>Q. I did not register for a particular event, but now I find I am available.  What should I do?</p>
        <p>A. On the program website update your availability for the relevant event.</p>
        <p>Q. I registered for an event but then discovered I was unable to attend.  But I did not cancel my registration. What happens?</p>
        <p>A. If you are not present at the posted meeting time, the space reserved for you will be assigned to standby crew, or it may go unused.  In either case, you will be recorded as a no-show and be given low-priority in future events.</p>
        <p>Q. I live some distance from the club, and the weather looks questionable.  How will I find out if the event is going ahead?</p>
        <p>A. On the morning of the event, the coordinator will be in touch with the boat owners.  They will decide which boats (if any) will sail.  Crew members will be informed by email as soon as a decision has been made.</p>
        <p>If the issue is strong wind gusts, it is likely to be the smaller boats that will withdraw.</p>
        <p>Q. I am available for a particular event, but I can’t get there by 12:45, or I must leave before 5:00.  Can I still participate?</p>
        <p>A. Unfortunately, and in fairness to your fellow crew members, you have to miss this event.</p>
        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        <p>Q. When I consult the calendar in the days leading up to an event, I find that I have been assigned to a different boat each time. Why is this?</p>
        <p>A. Every time a crew member registers or changes their availability, the crew assignments are recalculated.  This results in crew being moved between boats.</p>
        <p>Q. My partner and I would like to crew on the same boat. Can this be arranged?</p>
        <p>A. The principal aim of the program is to support the community of cruising sailors.  If you are looking for a recreational activity for you and your partner to share, we suggest you look into some of the other programs offered by the club.</p>
        <p>Q. My name regularly appears on the wait-list. Why is this?</p>
        <p>A. NSC members are given priority over non-members. In order to be recognized as a member, you must enter a valid NSC membership number when registering, otherwise you will be treated as a non-member.</p>
        <p>If you have been a no-show, your priority will be downgraded, whether or not you are a member.</p>
        <p>If you register within seven days of an event, spaces already assigned (whether to members or non-members) will not be available to you.</p>
        <p>To improve your chances of sailing, try these steps:</p>
        <p>Take out a club crewing membership,</p>
        <p>Always show up on time,</p>
        <p>If you find you have to cancel, do so straightaway, and</p>
        <p>Register early.</p>
        <p>Q. I am wait-listed for an event. How will I know if a place becomes available?</p>
        <p>A. In the event a crew member cancels, a place may become available and the calendar will be updated.  The calendar will be frozen at 10:00 AM on the day of the event.  Entries on the wait list are listed in priority order.  And, if another crew member is not present at the meeting time, their place will be assigned to the first person on the wait list.  So, it can be worthwhile to standby for an event.</p>
