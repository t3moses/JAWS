            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need to re-register every year?</h3>
                <p>Yep! We wipe the database clean at the end of each season, so everyone (including returning sailors) needs to sign up fresh for the new year.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I update my info?</h3>
                <p>Right now, you can't edit directly. Just hit up the admin to delete your account, then register again with your new details. Easy peasy!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why did I get a random AWS email?</h3>
                <p>That's just email verification! It's optional but recommended—it'll let us send you reminders and cool notifications in the future. The admin kicks off this process.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                <p>Starting out? Zero dollars! Completely FREE! Once you're hooked (and you will be), consider becoming a Crewing Member to support the program and get priority spots.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section faq-category">
            <h2>Events & Registration</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I registered but can't make it—what now?</h3>
                <p>No worries! Just update your availability on the website before 10:00 AM on event day. That way you won't get hit with a no-show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I freed up and can now join an event—how?</h3>
                <p>Sweet! Update your availability on the website. The system will auto-add you to the event or the waitlist depending on space.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens if I ghost an event?</h3>
                <p>Not cool! You'll get marked as a no-show and bumped down in priority for future events. Do it too much and you might get kicked from the program. Please update if you can't make it!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When's the registration deadline?</h3>
                <p>10:00 AM on event day. After that, the calendar freezes and any changes count as a no-show.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I know if bad weather cancels an event?</h3>
                <p>The coordinator texts/calls boat owners in the morning. They decide if it's safe to sail, and you'll get an email right away. We only cancel for serious stuff—lightning, crazy winds, or nasty air quality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I show up late or leave early?</h3>
                <p>Nope! You gotta commit to the whole thing—arrive by 12:45 PM and stay for the full 3-4 hour sail. It's only fair to your boat mates and the skipper.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section faq-category">
            <h2>Assignments & Matching</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why does my boat keep changing?</h3>
                <p>The system recalculates every time someone updates their availability. It's making sure crews are balanced across all boats. Your assignment might bounce around until the 10:00 AM deadline—totally normal!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I sail with my partner/friend?</h3>
                <p>Sorry, no! We're all about mixing it up and meeting new people. The whole point is building community, not just hanging with people you already know.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I request a specific boat?</h3>
                <p>Nope! The auto system keeps things fair by mixing everyone up. This way you get to experience different boats and learn from various skippers. Variety is the spice of sailing!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why am I always on the waitlist?</h3>
                <p>Few reasons this might happen:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not an NSC member yet (members get priority)</li>
                    <li>Previous no-shows tanking your priority</li>
                    <li>Signing up less than a week before the event</li>
                    <li>Event is just super popular</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pro tip: Become a member and register early!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I know if I get off the waitlist?</h3>
                <p>Check the events page—it updates in real-time when spots open up. Calendar freezes at 10:00 AM on event day. You can also show up as standby in case of last-minute cancellations!</p>

            <h2>What to Expect</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                <p>Here's the essentials list:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Closed-toe, non-slip shoes (MUST have!)</li>
                    <li>Hat, sunscreen, and sunglasses</li>
                    <li>Water bottle</li>
                    <li>Clothes for the weather (layers are smart)</li>
                    <li>PFD if you have one (we'll hook you up if not)</li>
                    <li>Good vibes!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Where do we meet?</h3>
                <p>Blue tent on the west lawn at 12:45 PM. BE ON TIME! If you're late, standby folks will snag your spot. Grab your ticket when you arrive—no ticket = no sail.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need sailing experience?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely not! We welcome everyone from total newbies to old salts. The whole point is learning and sharing knowledge across all skill levels.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long are the sails?</h3>
                <p>Each cruise is 3-4 hours, then we hang out on the club deck afterward. Saturdays are extra fun with raft-ups and potluck parties!</p>
